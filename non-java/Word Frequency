https://leetcode.com/problems/word-frequency/

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
For example, assume that words.txt has the following content:

the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
Note:
Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.

Solution:
grep -E -o '\w+' words | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{ print $2,$1 }'

Explain:
-E extended-regrex
-o only show the part that matching the pattern
uniq -c  'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent; -c means show counts
-n sorted by number
-r sorted in reserve order
the comma in the awk statement is significant.
